<summary>Motivation and differences with <a href="https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.vim">codeium.vim</a></summary>

**Motivation**

The primary reason for creating NeoCodeium was to address the
issue of flickering suggestions in the official plugin. This flickering was
particularly annoying when dealing with multiline virtual text. Additionally,
I desired a feature that would allow accepted Codeium suggestions to be
repeatable using the `.`, because I use it as my main completion plugin and
only manually invoke nvim-cmp.

**Differences**

- Supports only neovim (written in lua).
- Flickering has been removed in most scenarios, resulting in a snappier experience.
- Completions on the current line can now be repeated using the `.` key.
- Performance improvements have been achieved through cache techniques.
- The suggestion count label is displayed in the number column, making it closer to the context.
- Default keymaps have been removed.
- ~~Possibility to complete only word/line of the suggestion.~~ codeium.vim added this feature in [9fa0dee](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.vim/commit/9fa0dee67051d8e5d334f7f607e6bab1d6a46d1a).
- By default, there is no debounce, allowing suggestions to appear while
  typing. If you don't like this behavior, set `debounce = true` in the setup.

</details>

> [!Note]
> Requires neovim 0.10+ to work.

> [!Warning]
> Using this plugin your code is constantly sending to some codeium server
> with the help of their running instance of LSP on your machine.
> You can get acquainted with their [Codeium Privacy Policy](https://codeium.com/privacy-policy)
> From the plugin side, I have made all the possibility for it to not send any data from the disabled buffers,
> but codeium server is still running behind the scenes and I can't guarantee that it doesn't send something in that time (I have
> not inspected its behaviour with some network packets analyzer).

### üì¶ Installation

Here‚Äôs an example for üí§[lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager. If you're using
a different plugin manager, please refer to its documentation for installation instructions.

```lua
-- add this to the file where you setup your other plugins:
{
  "monkoose/neocodeium",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  config = function()
    local neocodeium = require("neocodeium")
    neocodeium.setup()
    vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-f>", neocodeium.accept)
  end,
}

```

Now you can use `Alt-f` in insert mode to accept codeium suggestions.

**Note:** To obtain an API token, you‚Äôll need to run `:NeoCodeium auth`.
On Windows WSL `wslview` `(sudo apt install wslu)` should be installed to properly open the browser.

### üöÄ Usage

#### üìí API

In addition to the already mentioned `accept()` function, the plugin also provides a few others:

```lua
local neocodeium = require("neocodeium")

-- Accepts the suggestion
neocodeium.accept()

-- Accepts only part of the suggestion if the full suggestion doesn't make sense
neocodeium.accept_word()
neocodeium.accept_line()

-- Clears the current suggestion
neocodeium.clear()

-- Cycles through suggestions by `n` (1 by default) items. Use a negative value to cycle in reverse order
neocodeium.cycle(n)

-- Same as `cycle()`, but also tries to show a suggestion if none is visible.
-- Mostly useful with the enabled `manual` option
neocodeium.cycle_or_complete(n)

-- Checks if a suggestion's virtual text is visible or not (useful for some complex mappings)
neocodeium.visible()
```

#### ü™Ñ Tips

<details>
<summary>using alongside nvim-cmp</summary>

If you are using NeoCodeium with `manual = false` (it is default), it is useful
to set nvim-cmp to manual completion and clear NeoCodeium suggestions on
opening nvim-cmp popup menu. You can achieve this with following code in the
place where nvim-cmp is configured:

    local cmp = require("cmp")
    local neocodeium = require("neocodeium")
    local commands = require("neocodeium.commands")

    cmp.event:on("menu_opened", function()
        neocodeium.clear()
    end)

    neocodeium.setup({
        enabled = function()
            return not cmp.visible()
        end,
    })

    cmp.setup({
        completion = {
            autocomplete = false,
        },
    })

</details>
<details>
<summary>Disable in telescope prompt and dap repl</summary>

    require("neocodeium").setup({
        filetypes = {
            ...
            TelescopePrompt = false,
            ["dap-repl"] = false,
        },
    })

</details>

<details>
<summary>Enable NeoCodeium only in specified filetypes</summary>

    local filetyps = { 'lua', 'python' }
    neocodeium.setup({
    -- function accepts one argument `bufnr`
    enabled = function(bufnr)
        if vim.tbl_contains(filetypes, vim.api.nvim_get_option_value('filetype',  { buf = bufnr})) then
            return true
        end
        return false
    end
    })

</details>

#### ‚å®Ô∏è Keymaps

NeoCodeium doesn‚Äôt enforce any keymaps, which means you‚Äôll need to add them
yourself. While [codeium.vim] and
[copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) set the `<Tab>` keymap as
the default key for accepting a suggestion, but `<Tab>` has some downsides to
consider (but nothing stops you from using it):
- **Risk of Interference:** There‚Äôs a high chance of it conflicting with other plugins (such as snippets, nvim-cmp, etc.).
- **Not Consistent:** It doesn‚Äôt work in the `:h command-line-window`.
- **Indentation Challenges:** It is harder to indent with the tab at the start of a line.

Suggested keymaps:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-f>", function()
    require("neocodeium").accept()
end)
vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-w>", function()
    require("neocodeium").accept_word()
end)
vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-a>", function()
    require("neocodeium").accept_line()
end)
vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-e>", function()
    require("neocodeium").cycle_or_complete()
end)
vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-r>", function()
    require("neocodeium").cycle_or_complete(-1)
end)
vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-c>", function()
    require("neocodeium").clear()
end)
```

#### üî§ Commands

NeoCodeium provides `:NeoCodeium` user command, which has some useful actions:
- `:NeoCodeium auth` - authenticates the user and saves the API token.
- `:NeoCodeium disable` - disables NeoCodeium completion.
- `:NeoCodeium enable` - enables NeoCodeium completion.
- `:NeoCodeium toggle` - toggles NeoCodeium completion.
- `:NeoCodeium disable_buffer` - disables NeoCodeium completion in the current buffer.
- `:NeoCodeium enable_buffer` - enables NeoCodeium completion in the current buffer.
- `:NeoCodeium toggle_buffer` - toggles NeoCodeium completion in the current buffer.
- `:NeoCodeium open_log` - opens new tab with the log output. More information is in the [logging](#logging) section.
- `:NeoCodeium chat` - opens browser with the Codeium Chat.
- `:NeoCodeium restart` - restarts Codeium server (useful when server stops responding for any reason).

You can also use such commands in your lua scripts by calling
`require("neocodeium.commands").<command_name>()`.

#### üìÜ User Events

NeoCodeium triggers several user events which can be used to trigger code. These can be used to optimize when statusline elements are updated, creating mappings only when the server is available, or modifying completion engine settings when AI completion is started or displaying hints.

- `NeoCodeiumServerConnecting` - triggers when a connection to the Codeium server is starting
- `NeoCodeiumServerConnected` - triggers when a successful connection to the Codeium server is made
- `NeoCodeiumServerStopped` - triggers when the Codeium server is stopped
- `NeoCodeiumEnabled` - triggers when the NeoCodeium plugin is enabled globally
- `NeoCodeiumDisabled` - triggers when the NeoCodeium plugin is disabled globally
- `NeoCodeiumBufEnabled` - triggers when the NeoCodeium plugin is enabled for a buffer
- `NeoCodeiumBufDisabled` - triggers when the NeoCodeium plugin is disabled for a buffer
- `NeoCodeiumCompletionDisplayed` - triggers when NeoCodeium successfully displays a completion item as virtual text
- `NeoCodeiumCompletionCleared` - triggers when NeoCodeium clears virtual text and completions

#### üöÉ Statusline

`require("neocodeium").get_status()` can be used to get the some useful information about the current state.
The best use case for this output is to implement custom statusline component.
This function returns two numbers:

1. Status of the plugin

        0 - Enabled
        1 - Globally disabled with `:NeoCodeium disable`, `:NeoCodeium toggle` or with `options.enabled = false`
        2 - Buffer is disabled with `:NeoCodeium disable_buffer`
        3 - Buffer is disableld when it's filetype is matching `options.filetypes = { some_filetyps = false }`
        4 - Buffer is disabled when `options.enalbed` is a function and it returns `false`
        5 - Buffer has wrong encoding (codeium can accept only UTF-8 and LATIN-1 encodings)

2. Server status

        0 - Server is on (running)
        1 - Connecting to the server (not working status)
        2 - Server is off (stopped)

To use output from `get_status()` for in-time update it is required to invoke this function
from [events](https://github.com/monkoose/neocodeium?tab=readme-ov-file#-user-events)
Personally, I'm not using statusline plugins, please refer to theirs documentation how to do it.
But in my statusline, I would do it that way with an buffer local variable, adapt it to your statusline
plugin requirements:

```lua
-- function to process get_status() and set buffer variable to that data.
local neocodeium = require("neocodeium")
local function get_neocodeium_status(ev)
    local status, server_status = neocodeium.get_status()
    -- process this data, convert it to custom string/icon etc and set buffer variable
    if status == 0 then
        vim.api.nvim_buf_set_var(ev.buf, "neocodeium_status", "OK")
    else
        vim.api.nvim_buf_set_var(ev.buf, "neocodeium_status", "OFF")
    end
end

-- Then only some of event fired we invoked this function
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("User", {
    group = ..., -- set some augroup here
    pattern = {
        "NeoCodeiumServerConnecting",
        "NeoCodeiumServerConnected",
        "NeoCodeiumServerStopped",
        "NeoCodeiumEnabled",
        "NeoCodeiumDisabled",
        "NeoCodeiumBufEnabled",
        "NeoCodeiumBufDisabled",
    }
    callback = get_neocodeium_status,
})

vim.o.statusline =
    -- here some your components
    -- ...

    -- add neocodeium_status
    .. "%{get(b:, 'neocodeium_status', '')%}"

    -- another components
    -- ...
end
```

<details>
<summary>Heirline.nvim</summary>

```lua
local NeoCodeium = {
  static = {
    symbols = {
      status = {
        [0] = "Û∞ö© ", -- Enabled
        [1] = "Û±öß ", -- Disabled Globally
        [2] = "Û±ôª ", -- Disabled for Buffer
        [3] = "Û±ô∫ ", -- Disabled for Buffer filetype
        [4] = "Û±ô∫ ", -- Disabled for Buffer with enabled function
        [5] = "Û±ö† ", -- Disabled for Buffer encoding
      },
      server_status = {
        [0] = "Û∞£∫ ", -- Connected
        [1] = "Û∞£ª ", -- Connecting
        [2] = "Û∞£Ω ", -- Disconnected
      },
    },
  },
  update = {
    "User",
    pattern = { "NeoCodeiumServer*", "NeoCodeium*{En,Dis}abled" },
    callback = function() vim.cmd.redrawstatus() end,
  },
  provider = function(self)
    local symbols = self.symbols
    local status, server_status = require("neocodium").get_status()
    return symbols.status[status] .. symbols.server_status[server_status]
  end,
  hl = { fg = "yellow" },
}
```
</details>

#### üé® Highlight groups

NeoCodeium offers a couple of highlight groups. Feel free to adjust them to
your preference and to match your chosen color scheme:
- `NeoCodeiumSuggestion` - virtual text color of the plugin suggestions (default: `#808080`)
- `NeoCodeiumLabel` - color of the label that indicates the number of suggestions (default: inverted DiagnosticInfo)

#### üìÑ Logging

While running NeoCodeium logs some messages into a temporary file. It can be
viewed with the `:NeoCodeium open_log` command. By default only errors and
warnings are logged.

You can set the logging level to one of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn` or
`error` by exporting the `NEOCODEIUM_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

Example:
```sh
NEOCODEIUM_LOG_LEVEL=info nvim
```

### ‚öíÔ∏è Setup

NeoCodeium comes with the following default options:

```lua
-- NeoCodeium Configuration
require("neocodeium").setup({
  -- Accepts boolean or function. If it is boolean and false, then neocodeium disabled at
  -- startup, until it is enabled manually. When it is function, it has one argument
  -- `bufnr` and should return boolean. With it, you can implement your own logic to disable
  -- neocodeium for your requirements.
  enabled = true,
  -- Path to a custom Codeium server binary (you can download one from:
  -- https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium/releases)
  bin = nil,
  -- When set to `true`, autosuggestions are disabled.
  -- Use `require'neodecodeium'.cycle_or_complete()` to show suggestions manually
  manual = false,
  -- Information about the API server to use
  server = {
    -- API URL to use (for Enterprise mode)
    api_url = nil,
    -- Portal URL to use (for registering a user and downloading the binary)
    portal_url = nil,
  },
  -- Set to `false` to disable showing the number of suggestions label
  -- at the line column
  show_label = true,
  -- Set to `true` to enable suggestions debounce
  debounce = false,
  -- Maximum number of lines parsed from loaded buffers (current buffer always fully parsed)
  -- Set to `0` to disable parsing non-current buffers (may lower suggestion quality)
  -- Set it to `-1` to parse all lines
  max_lines = 10000,
  -- Set to `true` to disable some non-important messages, like "NeoCodeium: server started..."
  silent = false,
  -- Set to `false` to disable suggestions in buffers with specific filetypes
  filetypes = {
    help = false,
    gitcommit = false,
    gitrebase = false,
    ["."] = false,
  },
  -- List of directories and files to detect workspace root directory for codeium chat
  root_dir = { ".bzr", ".git", ".hg", ".svn", "_FOSSIL_", "package.json" }
})
```

#### üí¨ Chat

You can chat with AI in the browser with the `:NeoCodeium chat` command.
The first time you open it, it requires to restart the server with
some chat-specific flags, so be patient (usually it doesn't take more than a few seconds).
After that, it should open a chat window in the browser with the context of the current buffer,
so you can ask some specific questions about your code base.
When you switch buffers, this context should be updated automatically (it takes some time).
You can see current chat context in the left bottom corner.

### üöó Roadmap

- [x] Add vimdoc help
- [x] Add the command to open buffer with the log output
- [x] Add :checkhealth
- [x] Add support for Codeium Chat (in browser only)
